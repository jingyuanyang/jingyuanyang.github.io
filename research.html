				My general areas of research have been data mining and business analytics with applications in marketing. More specifically, the focus of my research is to develop efficient and effective techniques to address various Business to Business (B2B) marketing challenges, to discover and understand the relationship among customer behavior and intention, and to ultimately assist intelligent business decision-making. My work has been published in top venues of data mining, including <b>ACM KDD</b>, <b>IEEE ICDM</b>, and <b>IEEE Big Data</b>, and one paper is under second-round review at the journal <b>IEEE TKDE</b>.

				<b>B2B marketing campaign recommendation-A social and temporal perspective.</b>: B2B marketing aims at meeting the needs of other businesses instead of individual consumers, and thus entails management of more complex business needs than consumer marketing. The buying processes of the business customers involve series of different marketing campaigns providing multifaceted information about the products or services. While most existing studies focus on individual consumers, little has been done to guide business customers due to the dynamic and complex nature of these business buying processes. To this end, in this work, I focus on providing a unified view of social and temporal modeling for B2B marketing campaign recommendation. Along with this line, I first exploit the temporal behavior patterns in the B2B buying processes and develop a <b>"Next Campaign to Run" (NCTR)</b> marketing campaign recommender system. Specifically, I start with constructing the <b>temporal graph</b> as the knowledge representation of the buying process of each business customer. The temporal graph can effectively extract and integrate the campaign order preferences of individual business customers. It is also worth noting that this system is <b>backward compatible</b> since the participating frequency used in conventional static recommender systems is naturally embedded in the temporal graph. The campaign recommender is then built in a lowrank graph reconstruction framework based on probabilistic graphical models. This framework can identify the common graph patterns and predict missing edges in the temporal graphs. In addition, since business customers very often have different decision makers from the same company, social factors, such as <b>community relationships</b> of the business customers, are incorporated for further improving the overall performance of the missing edge prediction and recommendation. In this way, the proposed approach can effectively improve the quality of the campaign recommendations for challenging B2B marketing tasks. A summary of the preliminary work has been published in published in <b>IEEE Conference on Data Mining (ICDM’15)</b>, and the extend version has been submitted to <b>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)</b> and is under the <b>second round review</b>.

<!--				An important aspect of my recent and current work considers the issue of how to precisely target the customers with high buying intention. In this line of work, I developed an effective buyer targeting optimization approach, which unifies the customer segmentation and buyer targeting these two tasks into an integrated and optimized way. The high-level idea of this work was to develop customized and precise predictive models according to the heterogeneity of customers, to improve the overall accuracy of buying prediction. <br>

				<b>Buyer targeting optimization-A unified customer segmentation perspective</b>: Due to the heterogeneity across the customer groups, customer segmentation and buyer targeting these two marketing tasks are combined in a simple step-by-step way for tailored marketing strategies. It is still unclear how to implement these two tasks in a more integrated and optimized way. Specifically, I formulate customer segmentation and buyer targeting as <b>a unified optimization problem</b>. Then, the customer segments are adaptively realized during the targeting optimization process. In this way, the integrated approach not only improves the buyer targeting performances but also provides a new perspective of segmentation based on the buying decision preferences of the customers. The unified customer segmentation and buyer targeting method not only quantifies the purchase tendency of a specific customer but also characterizes the buying decision behaviors at the segment level. I also develop an efficient<b> K-Classifiers</b> segmentation algorithm to solve the unified optimization problem. Moreover, I show that the customer segmentation based on the buying decision preferences can also be consistent with the features on customer profiles. Thus, this approach offers not only more accurate targeting of promising customers but also meaningful customer segmentation solutions with interpretable buying decision preferences for each customer segment.
